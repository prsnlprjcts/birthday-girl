Hope you let go of all of your worries and try to enjoy turning 23. I wish you happiness, love and support from everyone you know, less stressful days at work, more possibilities to relax and take care of yourself. I hope everything goes right for you and I really hope you can stop underrating yourself and realize how loved you are. Надеюсь больше не будет тупых 3600/5600 клиентов, бонусы каждый месяц, выполнение плана на работе и в жизни и lots and lots of fun. And I wish you to actually marry me asap. The “gift” I have for you is very personal to me. This is almost 7 years in one place. Not all of it but I hope you’ll believe me a little bit more when I say that I truly love you. So here it is (thanks for the title btw). Trigger warning: my heart and soul. This is in chronological order, so enjoy me embarrassing myself for years. "

I've never thought that it can be this hard. Like I wanna see her and I can't. She is so fucking far away and all we can do is just text each other every day at 23:07 and that's it. I tell her everything about my life and I so appreciate her but there is a reason why I am afraid. I am so scared of losing her. And now she feels bad and I can't change it. Yes, I can text her some sweet words. But I can't hug her, I can't tell her this in person. She is the best friend I have ever wished for. I would die for her if she needs it. She really feels bad and I'm just here, hundreds miles away from her, waiting for 23:07 to text her and again listen how she feels bad and not be able to do anything. I want to end my life. But I feel like the only person who would be sad - that's her"

You're everything I ever wanted and needed. I'm scared tho because I don't want you to think that I'm using you, you make me happy but that's not the reason I'm talking to you. The reason is you're a great person, I love the way you think and the way you feel. I love how smart and thoughtful you are. And you're so fun too. And beautiful!!! Everything good was put into one person and that person is you. God really took her time making you. I'm not saying you don't have flaws, everyone does. But for me it doesn't matter as much, because the amount of good things you've done is way bigger than a few bad moments."

Like chill??? You can't wait one day??? I don't get it. I feel perfectly fine when I don't talk to other people for days but with her it feels like a torture. It's scary as fuck. She's way out of my league and she's straight :) Lord help me."
